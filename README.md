## Program-Categories

I've organized the programs into various categories to make it easy for you to find what you're looking for:

1. **Basics**: If you're new to C programming. You'll find programs that cover fundamental concepts like variables, data types, and control structures.

2. **Arrays**: Dive into array manipulation with programs that demonstrate array creation, sorting, searching, and more.

3. **String Manipulation**: Learn how to work with strings, including string concatenation, manipulation, and searching algorithms.

4. **Math**: Explore mathematical concepts and algorithms, including prime number generation, factorial computation, and more.

5. **Graph Algorithms**: Delve into advanced topics like Kruskal's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm, and other graph-related problems.

6. **Advanced Topics**: Challenge yourself with programs that tackle more complex topics, such as data structures, recursion.

## Getting-Started

To get started, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git`
2. **Choose a Program**: Navigate to the program category of your choice and select a program to work on.
3. **Compile and Run**: Use a C compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile the program and run it.
   `gcc program_name.c -o program_name
./program_name`
4. **Explore and Learn**: Examine the code, modify it, and experiment with different inputs. Understanding the code is key to learning. The code may give you the answer you are looking for but the most important thing is you being able to code it yourself.
5. **Contribute**: If you come up with improvements, additional programs, or fixes, consider contributing back to this repository. See the [Contributing](#contributing) section for guidelines.

   ## Contributing

   Contributions are welcomed from the community! Whether you want to fix a bug, making the existing code more robust, adding appropriate comments, add a new program, or improve repo with more variety of quesitons(or some cool program), your help is valuable.
